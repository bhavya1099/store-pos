"""
Scenario 1: Testing the Normal Behavior of the Invoice Date
Details:  
  TestName: testGetInvoiceDate
  Description: This test is meant to check the normal functionality of the getInvoiceDate method. It is expected to return the set date for the Invoice.   
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required as the method doesn't take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the getInvoiceDate method.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is as expected (the set date for the invoice).
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the return value of the getInvoiceDate method is as expected. This test is significant in ensuring that the method works as expected under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Checking for Null Invoice Date 
Details:  
  TestName: testForNullInvoiceDate
  Description: This test is to check the behavior of the getInvoiceDate method when the Invoice date is null.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Set invoiceDate as null.
    Act: Invoke the getInvoiceDate method.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that if no date has been set for the invoice, the method will return null. It is significant to ensure the method handles null values correctly.

Scenario 3: Checking for Empty Invoice Date 
Details:  
  TestName: testForEmptyInvoiceDate
  Description: This test is to check the behavior of the getInvoiceDate method when the Invoice date is empty.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Set invoiceDate as empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getInvoiceDate method.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that if the invoiceDate is set as an empty string, the method will return an empty string. This test is important to ensure that the method correctly handles instances when the invoice date is an empty string.
"""  
Ensure to replace the expected invoice date with an actual date while writing the test code.
