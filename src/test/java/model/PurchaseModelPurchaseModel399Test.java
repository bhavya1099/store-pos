Scenario 1: Testing instantiation with valid inputs

Details:  
    TestName: testValidObjectCreation.
    Description: The test checks that an instance of PurchaseModel can successfully be created when all input parameters are valid and within acceptable bounds. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: All parameters are given valid values.
    Act: PurchaseModel constructor is invoked with these values.
    Assert: Each field of the PurchaseModel instance should correspond to the value it was assigned during instantiation.
  Validation: 
    This test is meant to verify that the PurchaseModel constructor works as expected. It is significant because if the object is not created properly, further operations involving it might fail.

Scenario 2: Testing totalQuantity Parameter with Zero

Details:  
    TestName: testZeroTotalQuantity.
    Description: This test checks the behavior of the PurchaseModel when initialized with a zero totalQuantity value. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: All other parameters are given valid values except totalQuantity, which is set to 0.
    Act: PurchaseModel constructor is invoked with these values.
    Assert: The totalQuantity field of the PurchaseModel instance should be zero.
  Validation: 
    The logic behind this test is to make sure that zero values are acceptable for total quantity. This is crucial in case an order has been registered but no actual items have been listed yet.

Scenario 3: Testing totalAmount Parameter with Negative Value

Details:  
    TestName: testNegativeTotalAmount.
    Description: This test checks how the PurchaseModel handles situations when initialized with a negative totalAmount.
  Execution:
    Arrange: All other parameters are given valid values except totalAmount, which is set to a negative number.
    Act: PurchaseModel constructor is invoked with these values.
    Assert: The totalAmount field of the PurchaseModel instance should be negative.
  Validation: 
    This case is important as the model should not accept negative values for total amount, and it will effectively test the handling of unacceptable values. 

Scenario 4: Testing with Null partyName

Details:  
    TestName: testNullPartyName.
    Description: This test is meant to verify the constructor’s behavior when instantiated with a null partyName.
  Execution:
    Arrange: All other parameters are given valid values except partyName, which is set to null.
    Act: PurchaseModel constructor is invoked with these values.
    Assert: The partyName field of the PurchaseModel instance should be null.
  Validation: 
    This will validate whether null values can be assigned to partyName or not. Such a case might happen where a party's name is yet to be registered but its order is recorded. 

Scenario 5: Testing totalDueAmount Less than TotalPaidAmount

Details:  
    TestName: testInvalidDueAmount.
    Description: An attempt to verify the constructor’s behavior when totalDueAmount is less than totalPaidAmount.
  Execution:
    Arrange: All other parameters are given valid values except totalDueAmount and totalPaidAmount, totalDueAmount is less than totalPaidAmount.
    Act: PurchaseModel constructor is invoked with these values.
    Assert: The totalDueAmount field of the PurchaseModel instance should be less than totalPaidAmount.
  Validation: 
    This test validates the business rule that totalDueAmount should always be greater or equal to totalPaidAmount.

These are few scenarios I could think of, given the description of the problem. Writing actual tests with implementation details and edge cases would require understanding of real-world business rules for these fields.
