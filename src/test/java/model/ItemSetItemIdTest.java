  Scenario 1: Test if properly handles valid itemId

  Details:
    TestName: setValidItemId
    Description: This test is to check if the function accepts and correctly assigns a valid itemId.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are directly providing the itemId to the method.
    Act: Provide a valid itemId (positive long number) to the method setItemId().
    Assert: Verify that the itemId has been set correctly by checking the itemId field of the object.
  Validation:
    Verification here signifies confirming that the itemId has indeed been updated. It is significant to ensure that the setItemId method functions perfectly for correct usage and data flow across the system.

  Scenario 2: Check if setter handles negative itemId

  Details:
    TestName: setNegativeItemId
    Description: This test is to check if the function behaves correctly when provided itemId is a negative number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No preparation needed as we are directly providing the itemId to the method.
    Act: Provide a negative number to the method setItemId().
    Assert: Inspect the itemId field of the object and make sure either it has not been updated or an error has been thrown.
  Validation:
    The test aims to verify whether the method appropriately handles an invalid itemId. It ensures that the system maintains data integrity by not accepting invalid inputs.

  Scenario 3: Test if function works with zero itemId

  Details:
    TestName: zeroAsItemId
    Description: This test is to certify if the function handles a zero itemId appropriately.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Need no arrangement as we are directly providing the itemId to the method.
    Act: Provide zero as itemId to the method setItemId().
    Assert: Verify whether the itemId field of the object has been updated correctly or an error has been thrown.
  Validation:
    This test helps to ensure whether the method can suitably handle zero itemId. The test aids in ensuring that the method maintains data accuracy and integrity.
