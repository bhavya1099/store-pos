Scenario 1: Checking getUom Method with Umom Value Assigned

Details:
  TestName: getUomWithAssignedUom
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getUom method correctly returns the "uom" string value when it has been assigned a value. It is targeted in a normal usage scenario where uom has a value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a string value to the uom variable.
    Act: Invoke the getUom method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value from the method against the expected string value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getUom method correctly returns the value in the uom variable when it has been assigned. This is necessary to ensure that the method can correctly fetch and return values as expected in the normal operation of the application.

Scenario 2: Checking getUom Method with Umom Value Not Assigned

Details:
  TestName: getUomWithoutAssignedUom
  Description: This test is designed to verify the functionality of the getUom method when no value has been assigned to the "uom" variable. It emulates a scenario where getUom() is called without prior assignment of a value to uom.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure that the uom variable hasn't been assigned a value.
    Act: Call the getUom method.
    Assert: Using JUnit assertions, compare the returned value against a null or empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is intended to confirm whether the getUom method behaves as expected when uom is not assigned a value. This is significant in guaranteeing that the method handles such a condition without throwing an exception or returning an erroneous value.

Scenario 3: Checking the getUom Method with Concurrent Calls

Details:
  TestName: getUomWithConcurrentCalls
  Description: This scenario tests whether the getUom method can correctly handle multiple concurrent calls. It aims to validate the thread-safety of the getUom() method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a string value to the uom variable, then set up multiple threads to call getUom method concurrently.
    Act: Invoke the method from all arranged threads.
    Assert: Assert that all threads return the same expected value using JUnit assertions.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that getUom method can correctly handle concurrent requests and return consistent results. This is significant for maintaining data integrity in a multicore/multithreaded environment.
