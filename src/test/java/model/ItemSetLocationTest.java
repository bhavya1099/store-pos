Scenario 1: Setting Valid Location

Details: 
  TestName: setLocationWithValidInput
  Description: This test is to verify that the setLocation method correctly sets the location when provided a valid string input.
Execution:
  Arrange: We don't need to arrange any data as just a simple string is inputted into the method.
  Act: Invoke the setLocation method with a valid location string.
  Assert: Use a getter method to get the location and check if it matches the previously executed setLocation method.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the location was properly set. This test helps to ensure that the functionality of setting a location works as expected in the application.

Scenario 2: Setting Location to Null
  
Details:
  TestName: setLocationWithNullInput
  Description: This test verifies the setLocation method when it is provided a null input. In Java, it is completely fine to set a string as null, but we need to ensure our application handles such situations appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: No data arrangement is needed as null is to be tested.
  Act: Invoke the setLocation method with null as parameter.
  Assert: Use getter method and Junit assert to verify if the value of location is set to null.
Validation: 
  This test is significant as sometimes users might not provide a location in all situations, leading to a null being set. This helps us ensure the method can handle such situations gracefully.
  
Scenario 3: Setting Empty Location

Details:
  TestName: setLocationWithEmptyString
  Description: This test is to check whether the setLocation method works correctly when it is provided with an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: No data arrangement needed as an empty string is the test object.
  Act: Invoke the setLocation method with an empty string.
  Assert: Use getter method and Junit assert to verify if the value of location is set to empty.
Validation: 
  This asserts verification that the location can be set as an empty string. This test is significant as it checks the scenario where users might accidentally enter an empty space or intentionally leave it blank. 

Scenario 4: Setting Location to Spaces

Details:
  TestName: setLocationWithSpaces
  Description: This is to test whether the setLocation method works correctly with a string that only contains spaces.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string that only contains spaces.
  Act: Invoke the setLocation method with this string.
  Assert: Use getter method and Junit assert to verify if the value of location is set to the space string.
Validation: 
  This test is to confirm that the method can handle a string that only contains spaces, and it would be useful if users input space without noticing it.
