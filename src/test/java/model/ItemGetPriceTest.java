Scenario 1: Test to Validate getPrice Returns Correct Value

Details:  
    TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue.
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getPrice method returns the correct price value previously set. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a known value to the `price` attribute. 
    Act: Invoke the `getPrice` method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned value matches the value assigned in the arrange step.
  Validation: 
    This asserts that our getter method correctly retrieves the value of the price attribute. The successful execution of this test demonstrates that the getPrice() method accurately retrieves the value of the price attribute.

Scenario 2: Test to Validate getPrice Returns Null for Uninitialized Price

Details:  
    TestName: testGetPriceReturnsNullForUninitializedPrice.
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getPrice method returns null when the price attribute has not been initialized. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No action necessary as the price attribute should be null by default.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the returned value is null.
  Validation: 
    This asserts that our getter method correctly handles the scenario where the price attribute is not initialized, returning null as expected. The successful execution of this test demonstrates that the getPrice() method correctly handles cases where the price attribute was never initialized.

Scenario 3: Test to Validate getPrice with Negative Value

Details:  
    TestName: testGetPriceWithNegativeValue.
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getPrice method returns the correct price value when it is a negative number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a negative value to the `price` attribute. 
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned value matches the negative value assigned in the arrange step.
  Validation: 
    This validates that our system can handle negative prices as well. The successful execution of this test demonstrates that the getPrice() method accurately retrieves negative values of the price attribute. This might be situationally based on business needs, like allowing for discounts or adjustments. 

Note: The getPrice method does not have any edge cases or error handling as it just returns a single value or null and does not perform any operations on the returned value.
