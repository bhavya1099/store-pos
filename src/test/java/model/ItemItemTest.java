"""
  Scenario 1: Test when Item object is created

  Details:  
    TestName: testItemObjectCreation.
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the Item object is created successfully using the given constructor. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No preparation is required as this is a test of a constructor.
    Act: Create a new object of type Item.
    Assert: Verifies that the created object is not null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the assertion "new Item()" does not return null which indicates that the object is indeed created. This is essential to make sure that all subsequent interactions with the Item object behave as expected.

  Scenario 2: Check default values for Item object

  Details:  
    TestName: testDefaultValues.
    Description: This test will check the default values (initialized or variables with no value) of an Item object upon its creation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
    Act: Create a new object of type Item.
    Assert: Check if all class variables (if any) are as expected by default.
  Validation: 
    This test checks if the default state of the Item object is as per expectation. This helps in validating the initial state of the object before performing any operations with it. Any deviation can signal that the object was not created properly which may introduce bugs later on.

  Scenario 3: Object Identity Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testItemObjectIdentity.
    Description: This test will verify the object identity of two created Item objects. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
    Act: Create two different Item objects.
    Assert: Check if the two created objects are not the same (i.e. they do not point to the same memory location).
  Validation: 
    The main purpose of this test is to ensure each "new Item()" gives us a new instance of Item. It ensures that each instance is unique and separated from others which is a fundamental property in OOP. It would be problematic if we find that multiple references point to the same instance unexpectedly.

    }
}

NOTE: Ensure 'Item' class is defined with fields such as 'name', 'quantity', 'price' and 'amount' and has getters for these fields. If Item class does not exist, it should be defined for these tests to run successfully.
