"""
Scenario 1: Testing for positive quantity

Details:  
  TestName: testSetQuantityForPositiveValue
  Description: Test to ensure that positive values can be set without any errors. The target scenario is when the quantity is a positive number.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Initialize a float object with some positive number.
    Act: Invoke the setQuantity method with the positive float object. 
    Assert: Use JUnit's assertEquals to verify that the quantity set is correct.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to ensure that the method behaves consistently for positive values. The expected result is that there are no errors or exceptions thrown.

Scenario 2: Testing for negative quantity

Details:  
  TestName: testSetQuantityForNegativeValue
  Description: Test to ensure that negative values are handled correctly. The target scenario is when the quantity is a negative number.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Initialize a float object with a negative number.
    Act: Invoke the setQuantity method with the negative float object. 
    Assert: Use JUnit's assertEquals to verify that the quantity is set as expected.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to ascertain that the method handles negative quantities as expected. The expected result is that there should be no errors or exceptions thrown, since negative quantities are allowed in some scenarios (such as inventory or refunds).

Scenario 3: Testing for zero quantity

Details:  
  TestName: testSetQuantityForZeroValue
  Description: Test to ensure that zero values can be handled without throwing exceptions or errors. The target scenario is when the quantity is zero.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Initialize a float object with a zero value.
    Act: Invoke the setQuantity method with the zero float object. 
    Assert: Use JUnit's assertEquals to verify that the quantity set is indeed zero.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to validate that zero values are accepted by the setQuantity method. The expected result is that there should be no errors or exceptions thrown. The test verifies the assumption that the method can handle zero quantities.

Scenario 4: Testing for null quantity

Details:  
  TestName: testSetQuantityForNullValue
  Description: Test to ensure that null values are handled correctly. The target scenario is when trying to set a null quantity.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Initialize a Float object as null.
    Act: Invoke the setQuantity method with the null object. 
    Assert: Use JUnit's assertThrows method to confirm that a NullPointerException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion intends to validate that providing a null value to the setQuantity method results in a NullPointerException being thrown. This is because NULL values are not permitted in this method.
