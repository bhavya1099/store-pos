ROOST_METHOD_HASH=getAmount_5deee03a09
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getAmount_377b23236c

Scenario 1: Verifying the returned amount is not null.
  
Details:  
  TestName: testGetAmountReturnNotNull.
  Description: This test will verify that the getAmount method successfully returns a Float value and doesn't return null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required in this test case, as no input parameters are supplied to the method.
    Act: Invoke the getAmount method.
    Assert: Use an assertNotNull() method to affirm that the returned amount should not be null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that method getAmount is working as expected and it does not returns null. This ensures that the getAmount method is successfully instantiated and returning the expected Float value.

Scenario 2: Verifying the returned amount is of the correct type.
  
Details:  
  TestName: testGetAmountReturnType.
  Description: This test will ensure that the returned type of getAmount method is as expected, i.e., Float.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No initial data setup is necessary for this scenario, as there are no input parameters for the method.
    Act: Invoke the getAmount method.
    Assert: Use assertTrue() to check if the returned object is an instance of Float.
  Validation: 
    The assertion checks that the returned amount is of the type Float to confirm that the function is working properly. It's important to ensure type consistency with the expected return value to avoid runtime error due to type mismatches. 


Scenario 3: Checking for the expected value returned by the method.
  
Details:  
  TestName: testExpectedValueReturn.
  Description: This test will validate that the value returned by getAmount method is as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the object with a known amount.
    Act: Invoke the getAmount method.
    Assert: Use assertEquals() to check if the returned amount is equal to expected amount.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method getAmount returns the correct amount. This ensures that the method works properly in obtaining and returning the right values as expected by the business logic. 

 
Scenario 4: Check if the method returns zero when no amount is set.
  
Details:
  TestName: testGetAmountReturnsZeroWhenAmountNotSet.
  Description: This test will validate whether the getAmount method returns 0 when no amount has been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the object without setting an amount.
    Act: Invoke the getAmount method.
    Assert: Use assertEquals() to assert that the returned amount is 0.
  Validation:
    This test confirms that if no amount is set, the getAmount method defaults to 0. This is crucial in handling potential edge cases where an amount hasn't been set yet.
