Scenario 1: Create PurchaseModel Object
  Details:
    TestName: validatePurchaseModelObjectCreation.
    Description: This test is meant to check if a PurchaseModel object can be successfully instantiated. As the PurchaseModel method is a default constructor, it is expected to run without any parameters or conditions required.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No required data setup as PurchaseModel is a default constructor.
    Act: Create an instance of the class PurchaseModel using the default constructor.
    Assert: Use assertNotNull assertion to check if the PurchaseModel object is not null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify whether the PurchaseModel object is successfully created or not by checking if it's not null. This test is significant to ensure that the PurchaseModel can be instantiated correctly, as it's base-model for all purchasing related operations in application context.

Scenario 2: Multiple PurchaseModel Objects Creation
  Details:
    TestName: validMultiplePurchaseModelObjectsCreation.
    Description: This test is meant to check if multiple PurchaseModel objects can be created simultaneously. This is to ensure that the object creation operation is thread-safe and robust.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No required data setup as PurchaseModel is a default constructor.
    Act: Create multiple instances of the PurchaseModel class using the default constructor.
    Assert: Use assertions to verify each instance as not null and each is a unique instance.
  Validation:
    Assertion aims to validate the successful creation of multiple distinct PurchaseModel objects. If the test passes, this indicates that the default constructor is capable of creating multiple, distinct objects, vital for multiple purchase operations that may happen simultaneously.

(Note: Since the method supplied is a simple default constructor, there are no edge cases or error handling scenarios that can be tested on it. However, if this constructor had access to mutable shared data or was reliant on system resources, additional test scenarios might be required.)
