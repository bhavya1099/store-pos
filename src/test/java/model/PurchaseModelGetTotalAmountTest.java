Scenario 1: Positive test to check if the get method is functioning correctly

Details:
  TestName: testGetMethod
  Description: This test aims to verify the correct functionality of the get method which is supposed to return the correct value of `totalAmount` already set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize `totalAmount` with a known value.
    Act: Invoke `getTotalAmount ()`.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned total amount with the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    The assertion checks if the same amount that was set for `totalAmount` is returned when `getTotalAmount` is called. If the get method is working correctly, it should return exactly the same value. Success of this test ensures that the get method is implemented correctly.

Scenario 2: Check if getTotalAmount method returns default float value

Details:
  TestName: testDefaultfloatValue
  Description: This test will check whether the `getTotalAmount()` method returns the default value of float when it is not explicitly initialised.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not initialise the `totalAmount` variable.
    Act: Call the `getTotalAmount()` method.
    Assert: Compare the returned value with 0.0, the default for float.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the default float value is returned. The underlying logic is to drive the aspect of Java where class float variables are assigned default values if not initialised. If this returns true, it ensures that Java fundamentals are intact even in the present context.

Scenario 3: Check if getTotalAmount method returns negative value

Details:
  TestName: testNegativeValueReturn
  Description: This test will verify if the `getTotalAmount()` method can return a negative value, meaning, it can handle any valid float input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialise `totalAmount` with a negative float number.
    Act: Call the `getTotalAmount()` method. 
    Assert: Compare the returned value with the negative float number set.
  Validation:
    Assertion checks if the get method is capable of suing diverse nature of the datatype float including negatives. This test is important in the context of flexibility and dynamism.
