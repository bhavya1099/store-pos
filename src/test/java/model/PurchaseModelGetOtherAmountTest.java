"""
Scenario 1: Validate the returned amount is correct

Details:  
  TestName: ensureCorrectOtherAmountReturned
  Description: This test case validates that when method getOtherAmount() is called, it returns the proper value. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the instance variable "otherAmount" with a known float value. 
  Act: Call the getOtherAmount() method. 
  Assert: Assert the returned value to be equal to the initially set float value from the arrangement stage.
Validation:
  This test confirms the method is correctly returning the value of 'otherAmount'. It is essential to ensure that the object state is accurately reflected when the getter is called.

Scenario 2: Ensure returned other amount is not a null value

Details:  
  TestName: ensureOtherAmountIsNotNull
  Description: Validates the getOtherAmount() doesn't return a null value. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as we are only checking a null scenario. 
  Act: Call the getOtherAmount() method. 
  Assert: Validate that the returned value is not null.
Validation:
  This test is checking that the 'otherAmount' value, regardless of its value, is not null. A null value may lead to NullPointerException in the places where this getter method is used, disrupting the overall program flow.

Scenario 3: Check returned other amount after updating the 'otherAmount' value in the object

Details:  
  TestName: ensureCorrectOtherAmountReturnedAfterValueUpdate
  Description: This scenario is to check that getOtherAmount() returns the correct value even after updating the 'otherAmount' variable. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the object's 'otherAmount' with a known float value, then update it with a different float value.
  Act: Call the getOtherAmount() method. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the updated value.
Validation:
  This test checks if the getter method accurately represents the updated state of the object. It's important in cases where 'otherAmount' can be changed after the object's initialization.
