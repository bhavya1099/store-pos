"""
Scenario 1: Test when the price is set with a positive value

Details:
  TestName: testSetPriceWithPositiveValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly sets the price when provided with a positive value.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required as there are no dependencies for this method.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a positive value.
  Assert: Assert that the set price matches the provided price.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the setPrice method correctly assigns the given price. It's significant because setting the price is crucial for business transactions.

Scenario 2: Test when the price is set with a zero value

Details:
  TestName: testSetPriceWithZeroValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly sets the price when supplied with zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required as there are no dependencies for this method.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with zero.
  Assert: Assert that the set price is now zero.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the setPrice method correctly assigns zero when provided. This is significant to ensure that items can be given away for free.

Scenario 3: Test when the price is set with a null value

Details:
  TestName: testSetPriceWithNullValue
  Description: This test is designed to handle the scenario when setPrice method is called with a null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required as there are no dependencies for this method.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with null.
  Assert: Assert that the price is now null.
Validation:
  This assertion validates that the setPrice method can handle null values without throwing an error. This is crucial for avoiding unexpected NullPointerExceptions.


Scenario 4: Test when the price is set with a negative value

Details:
  TestName: testSetPriceWithNegativeValue
  Description: This test is designed to check if the setPrice method correctly handles a scenario where a negative price is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: None, since no dependencies exist for this method.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a negative price.
  Assert: Depending on the business logic and constraints, assert that an error is thrown or the price gets set to the absolute value of the given negative price.
Validation:
  This validation ensures that the setPrice method handles negative values appropriately. Related business logic may require prices to be non-negative, making this a necessary test case.
