Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns correct location

  Details:  
    TestName: testIfReturnsCorrectLocation
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method getLocation correctly returns the location that is stored in the object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: The object should have an attribute location value  
    Act: Invoke the getLocation method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected location.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify the correctness of the returned location by comparing it with the expected result. This test is important as the application's behavior relies on the accurate retrieval of the location value from the object.

Scenario 2: Test to check if method handles null location 

  Details:  
    TestName: testIfNullLocationIsHandled
    Description: This test is meant to check how the getLocation method handles a situation where the object's location value is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object with a null location value.
    Act: Invoke the getLocation method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies how the method handles null location values. The expectation is that it should return null without throwing an exception. If the method passes this test, it demonstrates that it can handle objects without a location value, which is crucial in avoiding unnecessary program crashes.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method handles empty location 

  Details:  
    TestName: testIfEmptyLocationIsHandled
    Description: This test is meant to check how the getLocation method handles a situation where the location value is an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object with an empty location value.
    Act: Invoke the getLocation method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the returned value is an empty string.
  Validation: 
    This test is aiming to check how the method handles empty location values. The expectation is that it should return an empty string without throwing an exception. This test helps guarantee that the getLocation method can adequately manage situations where the location is not available.
