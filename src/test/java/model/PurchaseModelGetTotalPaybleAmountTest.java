"""
  Scenario 1: Testing the Basic Functionality of the Method

  Details:  
    TestName: testBasicFunctionalityOfGetTotalPayableAmount
    Description: This test scenario is intended to check the basic functionality of the getTotalPayableAmount method, ensuring it returns the totalPayableAmount correctly under normal circumstances.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement or data setup is needed as the method does not require any parameters and depends on a single variable which is presumed to be initialized already.
    Act: Invoke the getTotalPayableAmount method.
    Assert: Use JUnit asserts to compare the returned result against the expected totalPayableAmount.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method is functioning as intended by correctly returning the totalPayableAmount. It is crucial for validating the basic business logic of obtaining the total payable amount.

  Scenario 2: Ensure the Method Returns Correct Data Type

  Details:  
    TestName: testMethodReturnsCorrectDataType
    Description: This test case is designed to ensure that the getTotalPayableAmount method is returning the correct data type, which should be a floating point value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement or data setup is required as the method does not need parameters and relies on a single variable which is considered to be initialized already.
    Act: Call the getTotalPayableAmount method.
    Assert: Use JUnit asserts to verify the returned result is a float.
  Validation: 
    This assertion checks that the method's return type is as expected. Ensuring that the method returns a float is vitally important for integrations with other components that expect this data type.

  Scenario 3: Test the method with zero value

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetTotalPayableAmountWithZeroValue
    Description: This test case checks whether the method can handle and return zero value correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set totalPayableAmount to zero.
    Act: Call the getTotalPayableAmount method.
    Assert: Use JUnit asserts to verify the returned result is equal to zero.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies whether the method correctly handles situations where the total payable amount is zero. This is an important scenario to cover because it might be a legal business case in certain situations where no amount is payable.
